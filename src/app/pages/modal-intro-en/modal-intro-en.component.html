<div class="paragraph"><p>Maintaining open source projects is <a
  href="https://nolanlawson.com/2017/03/05/what-it-feels-like-to-be-an-open-source-maintainer/" target="_blank">hard
  work</a>. As NG
  ZORRO's user base has grown, we are getting more and more usage questions, bug reports, feature requests and pull
  requests every single day.</p>
  <p>As a free and open source project, NG ZORRO also has limited maintainer bandwidth. That means the only way to
    ensure the project's sustainability is to:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Prioritize more concrete work (bug fixes and new features);</li>
    <li>Improve issue triaging efficiency.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>For (1), we have decided to use the GitHub issue lists exclusively for work that has well-defined, actionable
    goals. Questions and open ended discussions should be posted to mediums that are better suited for them.</p>
  <p>For (2), we have found that issues that do not provide proper information upfront usually results in terribly
    inefficient back-and-forth communication just to extract the basic information needed for actual triaging. This is
    exactly why we have created this app: to ensure that every issue is created with the necessary information, and to
    save time on both sides.</p>
