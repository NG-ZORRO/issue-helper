# NG ZORRO Issue Helper

Inspired by https://github.com/vuejs/vue-issue-helper

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `issue-helper/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
